# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Tenant WordPress & OpenWebUI Platform on IONOS

**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Author:** @jubalm

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-tenant platform designed to host isolated instances of WordPress integrated with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin and OpenWebUI for various organizations (tenants). The platform aims to provide a scalable, manageable, and automated solution for deploying and maintaining these application stacks.
It addresses the need for organizations to easily deploy and manage WordPress and OpenWebUI without the overhead of individual infrastructure management.
A primary objective of the initial Proof of Concept (PoC) is to **showcase the capabilities of the IONOS cloud platform** for hosting such a solution, demonstrating its suitability for automated, scalable, and secure multi-tenant application delivery.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Demonstrate IONOS Cloud Capabilities:** Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) that highlights the IONOS cloud platform's strengths in Kubernetes orchestration, infrastructure automation, and application hosting for a multi-tenant SaaS offering.
- **Enable Multi-Tenancy:** Securely host multiple tenants (starting with a single tenant for the PoC), each with their own isolated WordPress and OpenWebUI instances.
- **Automate Provisioning:** Automate the setup of tenant infrastructure and application deployment using industry-best practices and tools.
- **Design for Scalability:** Design the platform architecture to support future scaling for an increasing number of tenants and varying workloads on the IONOS cloud.
- **Simplify Management:** Provide clear processes for tenant onboarding, lifecycle management, and configuration.

## 3. Target Audience

- **IONOS Stakeholders & Potential Customers:** To demonstrate the platform's capabilities for building and hosting multi-tenant solutions.
- **Platform Administrators:** Responsible for deploying, maintaining, and scaling the platform on IONOS, as well as onboarding and managing tenants.
- **Tenant Users:** Organizations or individuals who will use their dedicated WordPress and OpenWebUI instances for content creation and management.

## 4. Key Features & Functionality

### 4.1. Core Application Stack per Tenant

- Each tenant will have a dedicated WordPress instance with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin installed and configured.
- Each tenant will have a dedicated OpenWebUI instance.
- OpenWebUI will be configured to integrate with the tenant's WordPress instance via the MCP plugin for content management.

### 4.2. Tenant Isolation

- **Strategy:** Implement a robust tenant isolation strategy (e.g., using separate Kubernetes namespaces with strict NetworkPolicies and RBAC, or potentially separate Kubernetes clusters per tenant for stronger isolation). The chosen strategy will be documented.
- **Data Isolation:** Ensure data (WordPress database, file uploads, OpenWebUI configurations, logs) is strictly isolated between tenants.

### 4.3. Automated Infrastructure Provisioning

- **Tooling:** Utilize Terraform to create reusable modules for provisioning all necessary infrastructure components for a single tenant on the IONOS cloud (e.g., Kubernetes resources, networking including IP allocation, storage, IAM roles).
- **Parameterization:** Modules should be parameterizable for tenant-specific configurations.

### 4.4. Automated Application Deployment

- **Tooling:** Develop or customize Helm charts for deploying WordPress (with MCP plugin) and OpenWebUI within the IONOS Kubernetes environment.
- **Configurability:** Helm charts must support tenant-specific values (IP addresses for access, resource limits, secrets, connection details).

### 4.5. Networking and Access

- **Inter-App Communication:** Define secure communication pathways between a tenant's OpenWebUI and WordPress instances (e.g., via Kubernetes services within the IONOS network).
- **External Access:** Provide external access to each tenant's applications via a dedicated IP address (HTTP).
- **Production Routing:** Production will use dedicated domains with automated SSL/TLS and domain-based routing for secure, user-friendly access.

  > **Note:** For the PoC, external access will be provided via dedicated IP addresses over HTTP only, due to current limitations with domain name availability and SSL/TLS setup.

### 4.6. Data Persistence

- **Strategy:** Define and implement a strategy for persistent storage for WordPress (database, file uploads) and any stateful OpenWebUI data, ensuring isolation and recoverability, utilizing IONOS storage solutions where appropriate.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Outline a backup and recovery plan for tenant data.

  > **Note:** Backup and recovery implementation is out of scope for the initial PoC and will be addressed in future phases.

### 4.7. Configuration Management

- **Tenant-Specific Settings:** Design a system for managing and injecting tenant-specific configurations securely (e.g., API keys, database credentials, IP addresses for service exposure).
- **Secrets Management:** Integrate secure methods for handling sensitive data.

### 4.8. Tenant Onboarding & Lifecycle Management

- **Process Definition:** Outline an automated or semi-automated process for onboarding new tenants, including infrastructure provisioning (IP allocation), application deployment, and configuration.
- **Lifecycle Operations:** Define procedures for updates, scaling, monitoring, logging, and offboarding of tenants.

## 5. Technical Architecture Overview

- **Cloud Platform:** IONOS Cloud.
- **Orchestration:** IONOS Managed Kubernetes will be the primary container orchestration platform.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform will be used for infrastructure provisioning on IONOS.
- **Application Deployment:** Helm will be used for packaging and deploying applications into IONOS Managed Kubernetes.
- **Core Applications:** WordPress (with MCP plugin), OpenWebUI.
- **Key Considerations:** The architecture will be designed to leverage IONOS services for networking (LoadBalancers for IP exposure), storage, and security where applicable. The PoC will validate the core integration and automation on this platform.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Successful IONOS Deployment:** Flawless deployment and integration of WordPress and OpenWebUI for a single tenant on the IONOS cloud platform.
- **Showcase of IONOS Features:** Clear demonstration of how IONOS Managed Kubernetes, networking (LoadBalancer IP assignment), and storage solutions are utilized effectively.
- **Automation Demonstration:** Successful automation of tenant infrastructure setup using Terraform on IONOS.
- **Helm Deployment on IONOS:** Successful automation of application deployment using Helm charts into IONOS Managed Kubernetes.
- **Tenant Isolation Documentation:** Clear documentation of the chosen tenant isolation strategy and its implementation for the PoC.
- **Clarity and Presentation:** Clear documentation and presentation materials suitable for showcasing the solution to IONOS stakeholders, noting PoC simplifications (HTTP access).
- **Ease of Onboarding:** Demonstrated efficiency in the (simulated) onboarding process for a new tenant.
- **IP-Based Access (HTTP):** Successful external access to tenant applications via a dedicated IP address over HTTP.

## 7. Open Questions / Areas for Further Investigation

- **Scaling Multi-Tenant Architecture:** What are the best practices for scaling the platform to support hundreds of tenants?
- **Security Enhancements:** How can tenant isolation be further improved to meet enterprise-grade security standards?
- **Performance Optimization:** What tools and techniques can be used to monitor and optimize the performance of tenant instances?
- **Integration with IONOS Cloud:** Are there additional IONOS services that can enhance the platform's capabilities?
- **Cost Analysis:** What is the cost of hosting and scaling the platform on IONOS cloud, and how can it be optimized?
