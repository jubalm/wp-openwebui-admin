# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Tenant WordPress & OpenWebUI Platform on IONOS

**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Author:** Jubal Mabaquiao

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-tenant platform designed to host isolated instances of WordPress integrated with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin and OpenWebUI for various organizations (tenants). The platform aims to provide a scalable, manageable, and automated solution for deploying and maintaining these application stacks.
It addresses the need for organizations to easily deploy and manage WordPress and OpenWebUI without the overhead of individual infrastructure management.
A primary objective of the initial Proof of Concept (PoC) is to **showcase the capabilities of the IONOS cloud platform** for hosting such a solution, demonstrating its suitability for automated, scalable, and secure multi-tenant application delivery.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Demonstrate IONOS Cloud Capabilities:** Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) that highlights the IONOS cloud platform's strengths in Kubernetes orchestration, infrastructure automation, and application hosting for a multi-tenant SaaS offering.
- **Enable Multi-Tenancy:** Securely host multiple tenants (starting with a single tenant for the PoC), each with their own isolated WordPress instance and a user account in OpenWebUI.
- **Admin Management:** Ensure OpenWebUI administration is managed by platform administrators, with tenant users having non-admin roles.
- **Automate Provisioning:** Automate the setup of tenant infrastructure and application deployment using industry-best practices and tools.
- **Design for Scalability:** Design the platform architecture to support future scaling for an increasing number of tenants and varying workloads on the IONOS cloud.
- **Simplify Management:** Provide clear processes for tenant onboarding, lifecycle management, and configuration.

## 3. Target Audience

- **IONOS Stakeholders & Potential Customers:** To demonstrate the platform's capabilities for building and hosting multi-tenant solutions.
- **Platform Administrators:** Responsible for deploying, maintaining, and scaling the platform on IONOS, as well as onboarding and managing tenants.
- **Tenant Users:** Organizations or individuals who will use their dedicated WordPress and OpenWebUI instances for content creation and management.

## 4. Key Features & Functionality

### 4.1. Core Application Stack per Tenant

- Each tenant will have a dedicated WordPress instance with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin installed and configured.
- **Single OpenWebUI instance** shared across all tenants, with tenant-specific user accounts for isolation.
- **Authentik SSO** integration to manage authentication and sessions across both OpenWebUI and WordPress instances.
- OpenWebUI will be configured to integrate with tenant WordPress instances via the MCP plugin for content management.

### 4.2. Tenant Isolation

- **Strategy:** Simplified PoC approach using Kubernetes namespaces for WordPress instances with user-level isolation in the shared OpenWebUI instance.
- **Database Strategy:** Utilize IONOS MariaDB managed database cluster for persistent storage instead of CSI-based storage solutions.
- **Authentication Isolation:** Authentik SSO provides session management and user isolation across the shared OpenWebUI and tenant-specific WordPress instances.
- **Data Isolation:** Ensure WordPress data (database, file uploads) is strictly isolated between tenants, while OpenWebUI uses user-level access controls.

### 4.3. Automated Infrastructure Provisioning

- **Tooling:** Utilize Terraform to create reusable modules for provisioning all necessary infrastructure components for a single tenant on the IONOS cloud (e.g., Kubernetes resources, networking including IP allocation, storage, IAM roles).
- **Parameterization:** Modules should be parameterizable for tenant-specific configurations.

### 4.4. Automated Application Deployment

- **Tooling:** Develop or customize Helm charts for deploying WordPress (with MCP plugin) and OpenWebUI within the IONOS Kubernetes environment.
- **Configurability:** Helm charts must support tenant-specific values (IP addresses for access, resource limits, secrets, connection details).

### 4.5. Networking and Access

- **Inter-App Communication:** Define secure communication pathways between a tenant's OpenWebUI and WordPress instances (e.g., via Kubernetes services within the IONOS network).
- **External Access:** Provide external access to each tenant's applications via a dedicated IP address (HTTP).
- **Production Routing:** Production will use dedicated domains with automated SSL/TLS and domain-based routing for secure, user-friendly access.

  > **Note:** For the PoC, external access will be provided via dedicated IP addresses over HTTP only, due to current limitations with domain name availability and SSL/TLS setup.

### 4.6. Data Persistence

- **Database Strategy:** Utilize IONOS MariaDB managed database cluster for WordPress instances, providing isolated databases per tenant with managed backups and high availability.
- **Storage Strategy:** Use IONOS storage solutions for WordPress file uploads and static assets, with tenant-specific isolation.
- **OpenWebUI Data:** Shared OpenWebUI instance data stored in the managed database with user-level access controls for tenant isolation.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Leverage IONOS managed database backup capabilities for automated data protection.

### 4.7. Configuration Management

- **Tenant-Specific Settings:** Design a system for managing and injecting tenant-specific configurations securely (e.g., API keys, database credentials, IP addresses for service exposure).
- **Secrets Management:** Integrate secure methods for handling sensitive data.

### 4.8. Tenant Onboarding & Lifecycle Management

- **Process Definition:** Outline an automated or semi-automated process for onboarding new tenants, including infrastructure provisioning (IP allocation), application deployment, and configuration.
- **Lifecycle Operations:** Define procedures for updates, scaling, monitoring, logging, and offboarding of tenants.

## 5. Technical Architecture Overview

- **Cloud Platform:** IONOS Cloud.
- **Orchestration:** IONOS Managed Kubernetes will be the primary container orchestration platform.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform will be used for simplified infrastructure provisioning on IONOS.
- **Application Deployment:** Helm will be used for packaging and deploying applications into IONOS Managed Kubernetes.
- **Core Applications:** WordPress instances per tenant (with MCP plugin), single shared OpenWebUI instance, Authentik SSO.
- **Database:** IONOS MariaDB managed database cluster for persistent storage.
- **Authentication:** Authentik SSO for unified authentication across WordPress and OpenWebUI.
- **Key Considerations:** Simplified PoC architecture leveraging IONOS managed services (Kubernetes, MariaDB, LoadBalancers) for rapid deployment and demonstration.

## 6. Success Metrics
