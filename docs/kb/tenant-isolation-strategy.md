**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Author:** System Analysis  

## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the tenant isolation strategy for the multi-tenant WordPress and OpenWebUI platform on IONOS Cloud. After comprehensive analysis of available approaches, we recommend a **hybrid namespace-based isolation strategy** for the PoC with a clear migration path to separate clusters for production scaling.

### Recommended Strategy
- **PoC Phase:** Kubernetes namespaces with strict NetworkPolicies and RBAC
- **Production Scaling:** Separate IONOS Managed Kubernetes clusters per tenant group
- **Network Layer:** VPC-level isolation for enhanced security in production

## 2. Isolation Approaches Analysis

### 2.1. Kubernetes Namespaces with NetworkPolicies & RBAC

#### Description
Logical isolation within a shared Kubernetes cluster using namespaces as the primary boundary, enhanced with strict NetworkPolicies and Role-Based Access Control.

#### Implementation Details
- Each tenant gets a dedicated namespace (e.g., `tenant-orgname`)
- NetworkPolicies restrict inter-namespace communication
- RBAC ensures tenants can only access their resources
- Resource quotas prevent resource exhaustion
- Pod Security Standards enforce security policies

#### Pros
- **Cost Efficiency:** Single control plane reduces infrastructure costs
- **Resource Sharing:** Efficient utilization of cluster resources
- **Operational Simplicity:** Single cluster to manage and monitor
- **Fast Provisioning:** New tenants can be onboarded quickly
- **IONOS Integration:** Leverages IONOS Managed Kubernetes efficiently

#### Cons
- **Security Boundaries:** Shared kernel and control plane present attack vectors
- **Noisy Neighbor Risk:** Resource contention if quotas aren't properly configured
- **Compliance Limitations:** May not meet strict regulatory requirements
- **Blast Radius:** Control plane issues affect all tenants

#### Cost Analysis
- **Control Plane:** Single IONOS Managed Kubernetes cluster (~€50-100/month)
- **Worker Nodes:** Shared across tenants, cost scales with total resource usage
- **Storage:** Per-tenant persistent volumes
- **Network:** Single LoadBalancer with ingress routing

### 2.2. Separate Kubernetes Clusters per Tenant

#### Description
Each tenant receives a dedicated IONOS Managed Kubernetes cluster, providing the strongest isolation guarantees.

#### Implementation Details
- One IONOS Managed Kubernetes cluster per tenant
- Complete isolation at the control plane level
- Dedicated worker nodes per tenant
- Independent networking and storage
- Separate monitoring and logging stacks

#### Pros
- **Maximum Isolation:** Complete separation of control plane and data plane
- **Security:** No shared components between tenants
- **Performance Predictability:** No noisy neighbor issues
- **Compliance:** Meets strict regulatory requirements
- **Independent Scaling:** Each tenant can scale independently
- **Failure Isolation:** Issues in one tenant don't affect others

#### Cons
- **High Cost:** Control plane overhead multiplied by tenant count
- **Management Complexity:** Multiple clusters to monitor and upgrade
- **Resource Inefficiency:** Potential underutilization of resources
- **Slower Provisioning:** New cluster creation takes longer
- **Operational Overhead:** More complex backup, monitoring, and maintenance

#### Cost Analysis
- **Control Plane:** €50-100/month per tenant
- **Worker Nodes:** Dedicated nodes per tenant (minimum 2-3 nodes)
- **Break-even:** Cost-effective only with sufficient resource utilization per tenant
- **Estimated Minimum:** €200-400/month per tenant for basic setup

### 2.3. VPC-Based Network Isolation

#### Description
Network-level isolation using separate Virtual Private Clouds or network segments, can be combined with either approach above.

#### Implementation Details
- Separate IONOS VPC per tenant or tenant group
- Network-level firewalls and security groups
- Private subnets for application components
- VPC peering for controlled inter-tenant communication if needed

#### Pros
- **Network Security:** Strong network-level isolation
- **Compliance:** Meets network security requirements
- **Flexible:** Can be combined with other approaches
- **Traffic Control:** Fine-grained network access control

#### Cons
- **Complexity:** Additional network management overhead
- **Cost:** Additional VPC and networking costs
- **Routing Complexity:** Inter-service communication becomes more complex
- **IONOS Limitations:** Dependent on IONOS VPC capabilities and pricing

## 4. Recommended Strategy

### 4.1. Phase 1: PoC Implementation (Namespace-Based)

**Approach:** Enhanced namespace isolation with strict security controls

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# Namespace structure
tenant-<org-name>:
  - wordpress deployment & service
  - openwebui deployment & service
  - mysql database
  - persistent volumes
  - secrets and configmaps
  - network policies
  - resource quotas
  - service accounts with RBAC
```

**Key Components:**
- **Namespace per Tenant:** `tenant-acme`, `tenant-example`, etc.
- **NetworkPolicies:** Block all inter-namespace traffic by default
- **Resource Quotas:** Prevent resource exhaustion
- **RBAC:** Tenant-specific service accounts and roles
- **Pod Security Standards:** Enforce security policies
- **Ingress Controller:** Route traffic based on hostname/path

**Security Enhancements:**
- Admission controllers for policy enforcement
- Secret encryption at rest
- Network segmentation
- Container image scanning
- Runtime security monitoring

### 4.2. Phase 2: Production Scaling (Hybrid Approach)

**Approach:** Tier-based cluster allocation

**Small Tenants (1-10 users):**
- Shared cluster with namespace isolation
- Enhanced monitoring and resource limits
- Cost-effective for smaller organizations

**Medium Tenants (10-100 users):**
- Shared cluster with dedicated node pools
- Namespace isolation with node affinity
- Better performance isolation

**Large Tenants (100+ users):**
- Dedicated IONOS Managed Kubernetes clusters
- Complete isolation and independence
- Custom scaling and configuration

**Enterprise Tenants:**
- Dedicated clusters with VPC isolation
- Enhanced security and compliance features
- Custom SLAs and support

## 9. Migration Strategy

### 9.1. Namespace to Cluster Migration
When a tenant outgrows namespace isolation:
1. Provision new dedicated IONOS cluster
2. Export tenant data and configurations
3. Deploy applications to new cluster
4. Migrate persistent data with minimal downtime
5. Update DNS and routing
6. Decommission old namespace

### 9.2. Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform modules for cluster provisioning
- **GitOps:** Automated deployment and configuration management
- **Self-Service:** Portal for tenant provisioning and management

## 10. Conclusion

The recommended hybrid approach provides the optimal balance of cost-effectiveness, security, and operational simplicity for the IONOS-based multi-tenant platform. Starting with namespace isolation allows for rapid PoC development and cost-effective scaling, while the migration path to dedicated clusters ensures the platform can meet enterprise requirements as it grows.

This strategy leverages IONOS Cloud's strengths in managed Kubernetes while providing a clear path for scaling and security enhancement as the platform matures.
